My paragraph is going to be about pangolins.
# Pangolins   
   Pangolins are members of the Pholidota order despite their marsupial looks.
   They are mammals with large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. I love them because they look like small apologetic paladins.
