  This salmon is delicious.   
  They say it's quite nutritious.   
  The farmer said his wife is dead.

# Pangolins

   They are mammals with large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. I love them because they look like small apologetic paladins.
